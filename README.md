# 🎭 Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) Lab  
> “Exploits are cool, but humans are the real vulnerability.” — `@mSameerMalik`  
This lab demonstrates the use of the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) to create a realistic phishing attack scenario by cloning a legitimate website and harvesting credentials in a controlled environment.

## ⚙️ Objective  
- Clone a real-world login page (e.g., Gmail, Facebook)  
- Host it locally using Apache  
- Capture login credentials entered by a victim  
- Store and analyze the logs

## 🧪 Tools Used  
- Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)  
- Kali Linux  
- Apache Web Server

## 🚀 Attack Steps  
1. Run SET:  
   `sudo setoolkit`  
2. Navigate through the following options:  
   `1) Social-Engineering Attacks → 2) Website Attack Vectors → 3) Credential Harvester Attack Method → 2) Site Cloner`  
3. Enter the target site URL when prompted (e.g., https://accounts.google.com)  
4. SET clones the site and serves it from the attacker's IP  
5. Once the victim visits the cloned page and enters credentials, they are saved in `/var/www/html/`
